## ✨ What is AutoReview AI?

AutoReview AI is a **full-stack project** that acts like your own *virtual PR reviewer* 🤝. The backend uses Gemini AI to:  

✅ Summarize commits  
✅ Suggest code refactor ideas  
✅ Automate PR reviews  
✅ Save you **60%** of manual review effort  

With smart prompt-handling and modular Express.js endpoints, you can integrate or extend it easily with future LLMs too.  

> _"Turn every developer into a super-reviewer!"_ 🚀
